# Bechdel Test Analysis

**Abstract**: Our project aims to scrutinize the landscape of film through the lens of female representation, utilizing the Bechdel and Mako-Mori tests as analytical tools. These tests serve as cultural barometers for assessing women's roles in cinematic narratives beyond their relationships with male characters. The Bechdel test's criteria offer a starting point for evaluating the presence and interaction of women in movies. However, to capture the nuance and depth of women's experiences on screen, we also employ the Mako-Mori test, which broadens the scope by examining whether a female character has her own narrative arc that is not about supporting a man's story. The motivation is to quantify and qualify the evolution of women's portrayals in cinema, exploring trends, progress, or the lack thereof. We aim to tell a story of transformation and aspiration within the film industry, spotlighting the significance of authentic female perspectives and the journey toward equitable representation. This analysis not only reflects the cultural zeitgeist but also drives the conversation for future storytelling paradigms.

Research Questions:


- How have the trends in passing the Bechdel and Mako-Mori tests changed over the past few decades?
- Is there a correlation between a movie passing these tests and its commercial success or critical acclaim?
- What genres are more likely to pass or fail these tests, and what does this suggest about genre-specific representation?
- How does the representation of women in films from different countries or cultures fare when applied to these tests?
- What are the common narrative roles or character archetypes for women in films that pass these tests compared to those that don't?
- Are films that pass the Bechdel and Mako-Mori tests also likely to have more gender diversity among their writers, directors, and producers?
- Does the presence of a leading female character or a strong supporting female cast correlate with passing these tests?
- How do independent films compare to major studio productions in terms of passing these tests?
- To what extent do films that pass the Bechdel and Mako-Mori tests influence public discourse on gender representation?
- Are movies that pass these tests more likely to feature women in non-traditional roles or challenge gender stereotypes?
- How does the age rating of a film (G, PG, PG-13, R) impact its likelihood of passing these tests?
- What is the role of film festivals and awards in promoting films that pass the Bechdel and Mako-Mori tests?
- How have audience perceptions and demands influenced the number of films passing these tests over time?
- Can the data from these tests be used to predict future trends in women's cinematic representation?
- What impact, if any, do films that pass these tests have on the real-world issues of gender equality and female empowerment?
